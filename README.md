# Low-Level-Design-LLD-Practice-and-Notes
This repository contains my learning journey in Low-Level Design (LLD). It includes detailed notes, code implementations, and design patterns that Iâ€™ve studied and practiced. The goal is to build a strong foundation in LLD principles, explore various design paradigms, and solve real-world problems by designing scalable and maintainable systems. 
\# Low-Level Design (LLD) Practice and Notes
